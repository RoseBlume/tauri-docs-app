# docs-i18n-tracker

_This has been adapted from Astro's Starlight docs i18n tracker: https://github.com/withastro/starlight/tree/main/docs-i18n-tracker_

This folder contains scripts for generating a single-page dashboard tracking translation progress of pages in the Starlight docs site.

You can build the page locally by moving to this directory and running `pnpm build`.

The page will be built to `dist/index.html` in this directory.

The live version of this tracker is available at **<https://i18n.starlight.astro.build>**.
