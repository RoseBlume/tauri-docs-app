# Overview
Snap is a non distro specific package format that bundles all dependencies required into a snap. Snap is quite popular on linux due to the Ubuntu shipping with snap preinstalled. Due to this, it may be worth it to distribute your app as a snap.
Installation of Snap can range from being difficult to being more challenging depending on what distribution you are using.

### Debian, Ubuntu and RaspberryPiOS
##### Step 1. Install snapd
```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```
##### Step 2. Update to the latest version of snapd
```shell
sudo snap install snapd
```

### Fedora

```shell

```
##### Step 2. Enable Classic Snap Support

## Installing Snapcraft Your Base Snap
In order to bundle a snap you must install your choice of base snap such as `core22` and `core24`. Afterwards you must install snapcraft with classic snap support.
```shell
sudo snap install core22 # Change this to your desired base snap
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
```
