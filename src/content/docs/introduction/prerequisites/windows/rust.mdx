### Overview
Rust is a low-level programming language that aims to compile to the smallest binary possible, very quickly, and with very little overhead. It provides the user with a large amount of control and simplifies dependency management.
### Installation
Step 1. Go to [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
Step 2. Download the 64 bit Rustup-Init.exe script

It is recommend to use the default installation. If you wish to use newer, less stable rust features, you can change your default toolchain to nightly. It is important to note that you can always change your toolchain later by running the following command. 
```shell
rustup default stable # Change 'stable' to either 'nightly' or 'beta'
```
