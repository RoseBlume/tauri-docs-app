Tauri uses Microsoft C++ Build Tools for development. As such it is required that you install it before you begin making your app. It can be done by going to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

Once on the page, click **Download Build Tools** To begin the download. Once the download is finished click on the executable. 
#### Example
