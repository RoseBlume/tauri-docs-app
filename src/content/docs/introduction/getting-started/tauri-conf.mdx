title: Tauri Configuration
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

As previously mentioned, the `tauri.conf.json` is the tauri configuration file. It controls things such as the windows title, the default window size, and what bundles are produced when the app is built.
### ``tauri.conf.json``
```
{
  "productName": "example",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "identifier": "com.example.app",
  "build": {
    "frontendDist": "../src"
  },

    "withGlobalTauri": true,
    "windows": [
      {
        "title": "example",
        "label": "main",
        "maximized": true
      }
    ],
    "security": {
      "csp": null
