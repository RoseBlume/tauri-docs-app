title: Tauri Action Workflow
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.
---
## Getting Started

To set up `tauri-action` you must first set up a GitHub repository. You can also use this action on a repository that does not have Tauri configured yet since it can automatically initialize Tauri for you, please see the [action's readme](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action/#project-initialization) for necessary configuration options.

Go to the Actions tab on your GitHub project page and select "New workflow", then choose "Set up a workflow yourself". Replace the file with the workflow from [below](#example-workflow) or from one of the [action's examples](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action/tree/dev/examples).

## Configuration

Please see the `tauri-action` [readme](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action/#inputs) for all available configuration options.

When your app is not on the root of the repository, use the `projectPath` input.

You may freely modify the worfklow name, change its triggers, and add more steps such as `npm run lint` or `npm run test`. The important part is that you keep the below line at the end of the workflow since this runs the build script and releases your app.

### How to Trigger

The release workflow shown below and in the `tauri-action` examples is triggered by pushed to the `release` branch. The action automatically creates a git tag and a title for the GitHub release using the application version.

As another example, you can also change the trigger to run the workflow on the push of a version git tag such as `app-v0.7.0`:

```yaml
name: 'publish'

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'app-v*'
```

For a full list of possible trigger configurations, check out the official [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

## Example Workflow

Below is an example workflow that has been set up to run every time you push to the `release` branch.

This workflow will build and release your app for Linux x64, Windows x64, macOS x64 and macOS Arm64 (M1 and above).

The steps this workflow takes are:

1. Checkout the repository using `actions/checkout@v4`.
2. Install Linux system dependencies required to build the app.
3. Set up Node.js LTS and a cache for global npm/yarn/pnpm package data using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
4. Set up Rust and a cache for Rust's build artifacts using `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` and `swatinem/rust-cache@v2`.
5. Install the frontend dependencies and, if not configured as [`beforeBuildCommand`](../../reference/config.md#beforebuildcommand), run the web app's build script.
6. Lastly, it uses `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0` to run `tauri build`, generate the artifacts, and create a GitHub release.

```yaml
name: 'publish'

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

            args: '--target aarch64-apple-darwin'
          - platform: 'macos-latest' # for Intel based macs.
            args: '--target x86_64-apple-darwin'
          - platform: 'ubuntu-22.04'

        with:

          targets: ${{ matrix.platform == 'macos-latest' && 'aarch64-apple-darwin,x86_64-apple-darwin' || '' }}

      - name: Rust cache
        uses: swatinem/rust-cache@v2
        with:
          workspaces: './src-tauri -> target'

      - name: install frontend dependencies
        # If you don't have `beforeBuildCommand` configured you may want to build your frontend here too.
        run: yarn install # change this to npm or pnpm depending on which one you use.

      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__ # the action automatically replaces \_\_VERSION\_\_ with the app version.
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: true
          prerelease: false
          args: ${{ matrix.args }}
```
