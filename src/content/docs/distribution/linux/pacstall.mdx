description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

Pacstall is similar to the Arch User Repository, however it is meant for debian based distros. It is rapidly gaining popularity.

Step 1. Create a fork of pacstall-programs at https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs
Step 2. Create a folder within the packages directory with your apps name.
Step 3. Create your pacscript.
It is simplest to use the debian package that would be automatically released on github. All pacscripts that use a debian package source are required to be suffixed `-deb`. Using a debian source makes it much faster to install your application.
```ini
pkgname="appname-deb"
gives="${pkgname/-deb/}"
pkgver="2.0.3"
pkgdesc="A Bible App developed with tauri"
arch=('amd64' 'arm64' 'armhf')
url="https://github.com/Username/Your_Repository"
maintainer=("Firstname Lastname <email>")
depends=('libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev' 'build-essential' 'curl' 'wget' 'file' 'libxdo-dev' 'libssl-dev' 'libayatana-appindicator3-dev' 'librsvg2-dev')
source=("https://github.com/your_username/your_repository/releases/download/v${pkgver}/app_${pkgver}_${CARCH}.deb")
sha256sums_amd64=('81c917fdce366aa6d417fdae65306c5f4860fb9dc26c8ffa9a9b62c0d206c54a')
sha256sums_arm64=('bad20bfad1c337db35ee3f95d59ad5e70c4947b64aa6118de0953ddfec4c1538')
sha256sums_armhf=('8a8140bf7dcea4852a265b55bca332bb904d249627521b1bd1a985b383fd8307')
```
- The `pkgname` variable is given your apps name with the suffix of `-deb`
- The `gives` variable defines your executables name
- The `pkgver` variable is the version of your app and can be used when defining your source to improve maintainability.
- The `pkgdesc` is a required variable that contains a short description of your app.
- The `arch` variable contains information on which architectures your app supports.
- The  `url` variable links to your apps homepage.
- The `maintainer` variable defines who is currently maintaining the pacscript
- The `depends` variable contains a list of packages in which your app is dependent on.
- The `source` variable uses previously defined variable to improve maintainability and links to your apps deb files.

Step 4. Clone The `pacstall-programs` Repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs
```

Step 5. Enter the repositorys main directory
```shell
cd pacstall-programs
```

Step 6. Generate the **SRCINFO** for your package
```shell
./scripts/srcinfo.sh add ${pkgname}
```
Step 7. Upload your changes to github
Step 8. Open a Pull request with following title format
```
add: `pkgname`
```
